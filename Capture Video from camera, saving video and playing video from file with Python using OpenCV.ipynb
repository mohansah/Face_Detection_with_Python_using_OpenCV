    "# Capture Video from camera\n",
    "To capture a video, we have to create a VideoCapture object. Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file. Device index is just the number to specify which camera. Normally one camera will be connected. So I simply pass 0. You can select the second camera by passing 1 and so on. After that, you can capture frame-by-frame. But at the end, donâ€™t forget to release the capture."
